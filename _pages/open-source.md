# Open Source

**hexit** is a hex color guessing game for iOS. You see a color, pick the matching hex code, and improve your color intuition one round at a time.

This app would not exist without open source. A lot of hard problems are already solved by people who share great tools and ideas, and this page is our thank-you note to them.

## Thank You

Building an indie app as a solo developer is much easier because of the open-source community. If these libraries help your work too, please consider supporting their maintainers.
