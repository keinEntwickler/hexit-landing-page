# Open Source

**hexit** is a hex color guessing game for iOS. See a color, pick the matching hex code, and sharpen your color intuition one round at a time.

It is built with care on the shoulders of excellent open-source Swift libraries. We want to give a shoutout to the projects and people who make this possible.

## This Landing Page

This landing page is a fork of [Automatic App Landing Page](https://github.com/emilbaehr/automatic-app-landing-page) by [Emil Baehr](https://emilbaehr.com) — a clean, open-source Jekyll template for iOS app websites. We added multilingual support and customized it for hexit.

## Thank You

Building an indie app as a solo developer is only possible because of the generous open-source community. If you use any of these libraries, consider supporting their creators.
